           Many of the names used by companies to distinguish their
           products and services are claimed as trademarks. Where those
           names appear in any GNOME documentation, and the members of
           the GNOME Documentation Project are made aware of those
           trademarks, then the names are in capital letters or initial
           capital letters.
